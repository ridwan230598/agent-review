# Product Requirements Document

## Product

Review Agent Platform (`v0.1.0`)

## Problem Statement

Engineering teams need repeatable, machine-readable code review output that can run locally, through services, and in detached workflows while preserving strong schema guarantees and actionable severity signaling.

## Goals

- Provide a consistent review contract across CLI and HTTP surfaces.
- Support multiple provider backends through a shared interface.
- Produce deterministic artifacts (`json`, `markdown`, `sarif`) for automation and human consumption.
- Validate finding locations against changed diff lines to reduce false-positive locations.
- Support detached execution for longer-running review tasks.

## In Scope (Current Implementation)

- CLI command surface (`run`, `models`, `doctor`, `completion`)
- HTTP review service with start/status/events/cancel/artifacts endpoints
- Detached worker integration with Workflow API and in-process fallback
- Review targets: uncommitted changes, base branch comparison, commit SHA, custom instructions
- Provider modes:
  - Codex delegate (`codexDelegate`)
  - OpenAI-compatible (`gateway:*`, `openrouter:*`)
- Optional sandbox preflight for remote execution mode
- Optional Convex metadata mirror writes

## Out of Scope (Current Implementation)

- Persistent datastore for review runs (service and worker stores are in-memory)
- Authentication and authorization layer on HTTP endpoints
- Multi-tenant isolation, quotas, and billing
- Automatic retry/backoff orchestration for failed provider invocations
- UI frontend for review authoring or visualization

## Primary Users

- Developers running local/CI checks through CLI
- Internal services orchestrating review via HTTP API
- Platform engineers integrating review outputs into downstream tooling

## Success Criteria

- A valid `ReviewRequest` yields a schema-valid `ReviewResult` or a clear failure.
- Artifact generation is deterministic and available per requested output format.
- Severity threshold mapping produces predictable process exit behavior.
- Detached runs can be started, polled, and cancelled through service APIs.

## Non-Functional Expectations

- Strict runtime validation with Zod at API and provider boundaries
- TypeScript strict mode across monorepo packages
- Reproducible pipeline (`lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `build`) through root scripts
